# The Beer Game

This is an open-source implementation of the classic beer game by Jay Forrester. The beer game is an excellent introduction to supply chain management and illustrates the bullwhip effect to students.

## Version Update

We ran the game with two classes of 50 students at Koc University in Istanbul. It ran well, but we immediately spotted some features that would improve the experience.

The most recent version includes the following changes:

* The game now automatically shows the ending screen for players who have finished all rounds of the game
* If players enter a negative order, the order is replaced with 0
* If players enter an order above 50, they get a warning pop-up and are allowed to revise their order. Sometimes, players accidentally double-tap a key.
* The ending graphs of orders have a standardized y-scale that maxes out at 25
* The host can replace players with robo-players in the host screen; this is necessary when students sign in twice (creating a ghost in the system), or when students leave early.
* Players who join late (after a session starts) can still join by replacing robo players
* The host can tweak some game parameters in the upfront screen
* The host can download a list of players after the session is complete
* Added some AI-generated graphics to the sign-up and waiting screens
* Improved session hosting and control
* Added two optional features for beer game sessions: (1) an extra delay for orders (currently, orders placed in week t arrive upstream at t+1; with the extra delay, they arrive at t+2) and (2) backlog visibility (downstream partners can see the orders that are backlogged upstream). The host needs to activate these options during setup.

## Hosting

I host this version of the game [here](https://go.wisc.edu/394776). I added a guide on how to set up hosting yourself, for free, [here](https://github.com/siemsene/beergame/blob/main/Howtohost.md).

The hosted game runs on cloud services (Firebase). These services are free only up to certain daily usage limits. Above those limits, I incur out-of-pocket costs.

- The hosted game is **free to use** for typical classroom and workshop sizes.
- As a rough guideline, up to about **200 players per day in total across all hosts** fits comfortably within the free tier.
- Above that level, I may incur additional costs for database reads/writes, bandwidth, and related hosting resources.

I reserve the right to:

- Limit or throttle access (for example, limiting new games if daily usage is very high), and/or
- Ask heavy users to share in the actual hosting costs their sessions generate.

## Other Beer Games

You can buy the original beer game materials from the [System Dynamics Society](https://systemdynamics.org/product/supply-chain-game-the-beer-game-complete-game-set/). There are other free online versions of the beer game available, such as those at [Transentis](https://beergame.transentis.com/) or [MA Systems](https://beergame.masystem.se/). There are also paid versions at [HB Online](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/7908-HTM-ENG), [Zensimu](https://zensimu.com/p/beer-game/), and [FathomD](https://www.fathomd.com/bdg).

## License

This version of the beer game is open source and has a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). You can use it for free, and you can modify the code as you see fit; but anything you build on this code has to fall under the same license.

## How to Start a Session

I am currently hosting a version of this code [here](https://the-beer-game-37777398-4d5fb.web.app/). You can use it for teaching if you like.

To host a game, you first need to log in as a host; it will ask you for a password, which is 'Sesame'. I know - not very secure, but enough for now. You can then create a new session with a Game ID. You can share this ID with students, who can then log in with this game ID and a Name. This can be any name, but they should remember it, since if they get disconnected from the game, they can always reconnect using the Game ID and their name as long as the session is still running.

You can test this out yourself with multiple browser tabs.

You can monitor the lobby as the host and remove players if you want to. When all players have registered, you can start the game. The app will automatically assign students to teams and roles (at random) and fill teams with robo players (called Beer-GPT) if the number of students in the lobby is not divisible by 4.

## Game Rules

The game uses the standard beer game demand and cost data. Shipping lead time is 2, but order lead time is only 1 - downstream partners will see the order placed in the prior period.

The game lasts 40 periods, but can be ended at any time in the host's view. Upon completion, the host will see a leaderboard and graphs for all supply chains, showing their orders. Each supply chain will see its own total costs, as well as a graph of all orders in the supply chain.

Beer-GPT players will always place an order based on the demand they see, +/-1.
